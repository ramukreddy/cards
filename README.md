### Building a deck of poker-style playing cards using Java

Cards (Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, with
face values of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.)

#### There are two main methods in [DeckOfCards.java](https://github.com/ramukreddy/cards/blob/master/src/main/java/cards/DeckOfCards.java)
1. shuffle() : Returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly permuted.
2. dealOneCard : Return one card from the deck to the caller. If no cards, returns empty

#### Running app
* Make sure you have Java 8 and Gradle (https://gradle.org/install/)
* go to project directory 
* Run: gradle test
